# This sets the human-readable name of the workflow
name: CI - Build & Test

# This section defines which GitHub events will trigger this workflow
on:
  # This event triggers on every Pull Request
  pull_request:

  # This event triggers on pushes to branches
  push:
    # We restrict push triggers to the main branch
    branches:
      - main

# This section defines the jobs that will run in this workflow
jobs:
  # First job: build and type-check
  build:
    # Use an Ubuntu Linux runner image
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps that will run in the build job
    steps:
      # Step: checkout the repo code to the runner file system
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step: setup Node.js runtime
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          # Use Node.js version 20
          node-version: 20

      # Step: install pnpm package manager
      - name: Setup pnpm
        uses: pnpm/action-setup@v2
        with:
          # Use pnpm version 8 (matches your tooling)
          version: 8

      # Step: install project dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        # Run pnpm install to restore node_modules
        run: pnpm install

      # Step: run TypeScript type-check to validate build correctness
      - name: Type check (build validation)
        # Use tsc in noEmit mode to only check types
        run: pnpm tsc --noEmit

  # Second job: lint + unit tests + Playwright tests
  test:
    # This job depends on the build job and runs only if build succeeds
    needs: build
    # Use the same Ubuntu Linux runner
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # This env block defines environment variables for all steps in this job
    env:
      # This provides a SESSION_SECRET value in CI so env schema validation passes
      # It is a dummy value, safe for tests, not used for real production secrets
      SESSION_SECRET: ci-session-secret

    # Steps for the test job
    steps:
      # Step: checkout the repo again (each job starts in a fresh environment)
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step: setup Node.js runtime for tests
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          # Same Node.js version as in build for consistency
          node-version: 20

      # Step: install pnpm for this job
      - name: Setup pnpm
        uses: pnpm/action-setup@v2
        with:
          # Same pnpm version as in build
          version: 8

      # Step: install project dependencies for tests
      - name: Install dependencies
        # Again, run pnpm install; cache speeds this up on repeated runs
        run: pnpm install

      # Step: run ESLint to detect style and potential bug issues
      - name: Run ESLint (lint)
        # Uses your "lint" script defined in package.json
        run: pnpm lint

      # Step: run TypeScript type-check inside test job as part of quality gate
      - name: Run TypeScript type-check
        # Same tsc noEmit command
        run: pnpm tsc --noEmit

      # Step: run unit and contract tests using Vitest
      - name: Run unit tests
        # Uses your "test:unit" script
        run: pnpm test:unit

      # Step: install Playwright browsers on the CI runner
      - name: Install Playwright browsers
        # Use Playwright CLI to install Chromium/Firefox/WebKit plus dependencies
        run: npx playwright install --with-deps

      # Step: run Playwright UI/API tests as configured in playwright.config.ts
      - name: Run Playwright tests
        # Uses your "test" script which maps to "playwright test"
        run: pnpm test

      # Step: upload Playwright report when any previous step in this job fails
      - name: Upload Playwright report on failure
        # This condition ensures this runs only if the job failed
        if: failure()
        # Use GitHub's artifact upload action
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          # Name of the artifact shown in the Actions UI
          name: playwright-report
          # Path to the HTML report folder generated by Playwright
          path: playwright-report
          # If there is no report folder, ignore it instead of failing
          if-no-files-found: ignore
          # Keep artifacts for 7 days for investigation
          retention-days: 7
